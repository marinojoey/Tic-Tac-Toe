Simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. Took around 3 days. Every stage of this project was a big learning opportunity. Endgame logic probably being the hardest to figure out. 

In the future I might make an AI to play against. I would also like to figure out the problems when playing on mobile (why the cell's text content does not fill before the alert).
